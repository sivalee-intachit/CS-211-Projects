# CS-211
This repository stores various projects that I've completed throughout my Object Oriented Programming course at GMU (CS 211, Spring 2023) in order to exhibit the progress I've made as a developer. This not only includes my understanding of Java/Object Oriented Programming principles but also my ability to develop solutions for various scenarios and to persevere with development regardless of the task's difficulty. 

Especially since this course is where I've first utilized Java, there'll be a lot of 'naive' techniques that are used especially throughout the earlier projects that I've completed. Expect some syntactical or logical flaws in some, or not, all of these projects.

Per course requirements, these projects were developed using Java 8. I've experimented with different IDEs for different projects throughout this course; I've started off with using Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA CE before settling with Eclipse towards the second half of the semester.
