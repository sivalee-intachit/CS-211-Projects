# CS-211
This repository stores various projects that I've completed throughout my Object Oriented Programming course at GMU (CS 211). This course was based on Java, and taught by Professor Socrates Dimitriadis. 

Per course requirements, these projects were developed using Java 8. I've experimented with different IDEs for different projects throughout this course; I've started off with using Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA CE before migrating/sticking to Eclipse later in the course.

The main purpose of this repository is to show the progress I've made as a developer. This not only includes my understanding of Java/Object Oriented Programming principles, but also my ability to develop solutions for various scenarios and to persevere with development regardless of the task's difficulty. Especially since this course is where I've first utilized Java, there'll be a lot of 'naive' techniques that are used especially throughout the earlier projects that I've completed.
