# CS-211
This repository stores the projects that I've completed throughout my Object Oriented Programming course at GMU (CS 211, Spring 2023) in order to exhibit the progress I've made as a developer. This not only includes my understanding of Java/Object Oriented Programming principles but also my ability to develop solutions for various scenarios and to persevere with development regardless of the task's difficulty. 

In each project folder, you'll find the instructions for the assigned project as well as a sub-folder which holds the source code for the corresponding project.

Per course requirements, these projects were developed using Java 8. I've experimented with different IDEs for different projects throughout this course; I've started off with using Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA CE before settling with Eclipse towards the second half of the semester (starting in Project 3).

Especially since it wasn't until this course where I first starting coding in Java, expect some syntactical or logical flaws in some, or not, all of these projects.
